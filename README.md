## Usage

Using OpenLoom is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to read a file asynchronously:

```java
import com.openloom.FileReader;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FileReader reader = new FileReader("path/to/your/file.txt");
        reader.readAsync(content -> {
            System.out.println("File content: " + content);
        });
    }
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to read a file without blocking your application.

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic File Reading

```java
import com.openloom.FileReader;

public class BasicRead {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FileReader reader = new FileReader("example.txt");
        reader.readAsync(content -> {
            System.out.println("Content: " + content);
        });
    }
}
```

### Example 2: Streaming Large Files
